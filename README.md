## Amazon Reviews Dataset

The raw Amazon reviews dataset consists of reviews from amazon. The data span a period of 18 years, including ~35 million reviews up to March 2013. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review. The dataset can be accessed from [Stanford SNAP's website](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html#:~:text=This%20dataset%20consists%20of%20reviews,ratings%2C%20and%20a%20plaintext%20review.&text=gz)%20to%20help%20identify%20products,potentially%20duplicates%20of%20each%20other) 

The dataset used in this project is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above mentioned Amazon review dataset, which can be accessed from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M) 

The Amazon reviews full score dataset is constructed by randomly taking 600,000 training samples and 130,000 testing samples for each review score from 1 to 5. In total there are 3,000,000 trainig samples and 650,000 testing samples.
